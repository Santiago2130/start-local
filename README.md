# Try Elasticsearch and Kibana locally

Try Elasticsearch and Kibana using a simple shell script for local
development. It uses [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to install
the services and offers a trial [Platinum](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions)
license for 1 month. After the month the license will become
[Free and Open Basic](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

For instance, the Platinum version offers [ELSER](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html) retrieval model and the [Inference API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/inference-apis.html).
The Free and Open Basic includes the [vector search](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/vector-search) 
and [ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql.html).
For a full list of subscription and features [read this page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

This script can be executed only on Linux and Mac environments.
We do not support Microsoft Windows at the moment.

**Please note**: this script is only for local testing, do not
run it in a production environment!

For production installation please reference to the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
For Kibana, [this is the page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana) to read.

## How to execute the script

The **start-local** script has been designed to be executed using [curl](https://curl.se/),
as follows (NOTE: the script has not yet been published on elastic.co):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

The script will create the`elastic-start-local` folder with two files:
`docker-compose.yml` and `.env`. The first `docker-compose.yml` is a standard
docker file containing the configurations for Elasticsearch and Kibana services.
The second file `.env` contains all the settings, like the Elasticsearch password.

## After the execution

After executing the start-local script you will have Elasticsearch
running on http://localhost:9200 and Kibana on http://localhost:5601.

The script generates a random password for the `elastic` user. The password
is displayed at the end of the installation and stored in the `.env` file.

We disabled HTTPS and we used Basic acces authentication to connect to Elasticsearch.
This configuration should be used only for local testing.
For security reason, Elasticsearch and Kibana are accessible only using localhost.

We also generated an API key for Elasticsearch, this can be useful to connect
to Elasticsearch using the [Elastic SDK](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client)
or directly with [REST API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html). 
The API key is stored in the `.env` file with the key `ES_LOCAL_API_KEY`.

For instance, using [curl](https://curl.se/), you can check the connection to Elasticsearch
using the following command, inside the `elastic-start-local` folder:

```bash
. .env
curl $ES_LOCAL_URL -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${ES_LOCAL_API}"
```

## Docker compose

If you navigate to the `elastic-start-local` folder, you can manage the services
using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/) command.

For instance, to restart the services, you can run the command:

```bash
docker compose up --wait
```
To stop the services you can run the command:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

If you are using `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose` the syntax
is the same, apart for the `up --wait` option which may not be available.
In this case you can use the following command, to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Uninstall

We provided a `uninstall.sh` script for removing the installation
of start-local.

You can just run this script. Please note, this will erase all data
without the possibility of recovery.

```bash
cd elastic-start-local
./uninstall.sh
```

## Logging

In case of failure, the start-local generates a log error in the file
`error-start-local.log`.

This file contains the logs generated by Elasticsearch and Kibana using the
[docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/) command.

## How to change the settings

If you want to change the settings, for instance the Elasticsearch password,
you can edit the `.env` file and change the values.

The `.env` file contains some settings like as follows:

```bash
ES_LOCAL_VERSION=8.15.2
ES_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:9200
ES_LOCAL_CONTAINER_NAME=es-local-dev
ES_LOCAL_DOCKER_NETWORK=elastic-net
ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD=hOalVFrN
ES_LOCAL_PORT=9200
KIBANA_LOCAL_CONTAINER_NAME=kibana-local-dev
KIBANA_LOCAL_PORT=5601
KIBANA_LOCAL_PASSWORD=YJFbhLJL
ES_LOCAL_API_KEY=df34grtk...==
```

For instance, `ES_LOCAL_VERSION` is the Elasticsearch and Kibana version used
for the installation (e.g. 8.15.2).

After changing the `.env` file you need to restart the services using the command:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

If you are using `docker-compose` the command will be:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

## Testing the installer

We used [bashunit](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/) for testing the script.

The tests are in the `/tests` folder.

To run the tests you need first to install bashunit as follows:

```bash
curl -s https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/install.sh | bash
```

This command will create a `lib` folder with the `bashunit`
command. 

You can now execute the tests using the following command:

```bash
lib/bashunit
```

The tests execute the `start-local.sh` and check if Elasticsearch
and Kibana are running. 

We also executed a local web server to test the installation
using a pipeline from an URL. To test this you need to have [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
installed.
